All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`     | Installs dependencies                        |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`  |
| `npm run build`   | Build your production site to `./dist/`      |
| `npm run preview` | Preview your build locally, before deploying |

<br />

## 👀 Note

- Complete application lives in the `master` branch i.e., `git checkout master`
- Checkout to the `clean-slate` branch to code along or start afresh i.e., `git checkout clean-slate`
- Building the application is covered in Chapter 8 of [the book](https://github.com/understanding-astro/understanding-astro-book)
